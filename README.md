# 👏 Clap Switch – Home Automation Project

## 📌 Project Overview
A **Clap Switch** is an electronic device that allows you to control appliances (like lights or fans) by simply clapping your hands.  
It works by converting sound energy from a clap into electrical pulses, which are processed by a control circuit to switch devices ON or OFF.

This project is a **home automation system** designed to be energy-efficient, cost-effective, and helpful for mobility-impaired persons.

## ⚙ Working Principle
- The **microphone** detects clap sounds and converts them into small electrical signals.
- These signals are **amplified** and fed into a **flip-flop circuit**.
- The circuit changes the state of a **relay**, turning an appliance ON or OFF.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Zero PCB Board  
- 4017 IC (x2)  
- Relay (9V)  
- Variable Resistor (1K)  
- Resistors (10K, 1K)  
- Transistor BC547  
- LEDs  
- Microphone (sound sensor)  

---

## 🔍 Advantages
- Control electrical loads like lights or fans from anywhere in the room by clapping.
- Energy-efficient and low cost.
- Reliable and accurate.
- No manual switching required.

## ⚠ Disadvantages
- Background noise can trigger the switch accidentally.
- Sometimes using a regular switch is more convenient.

---

## 📂 Applications
- Controlling lights, fans, TV, motors, and ACs.
- Assisting mobility-impaired persons and elderly people.

## 🏁 Conclusion
The clap switch is a simple yet effective home automation system.  
By detecting clap sounds through a microphone and processing the signal, it can control electrical appliances without physical contact.
